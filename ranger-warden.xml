            <p>Wardens are rangers that are the mysterious guardians of both urban cities and dense jungles. They watch over their territory with keen eyes, ready to defend the weak wherever they may be attacked. They appear in a flash and disappear with a crack like lightning. Wardens, unlike most rangers, have taken up a path of lead and iron to help them defend others, and their keen senses make them excellent marksmen, both from the treetops, and from up close.</p>

            <p>7th level Wardens let nothing escape their watchful eyes, and are experts at dodging wide area attacks, such as a storm of bullets or acidic waves. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.</p>

            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Barrage.</em></strong> You can make a ranged attack at every target available in a 15 foot wide line within within your weapon’s normal range.

            <p>At 15th level, you have become a vigilant guardian for all those you protect, be it from close range or afar. You can use a reaction in order to take a shot at any enemy that is within your weapon’s normal range if they attempt to attack or cast a spell at any creatures friendly to you. If you hit, the creature's attack or spell automatically fails, dealing no damage if it would normally do so. If they were casting a spell, the spellslot is wasted.</p>
