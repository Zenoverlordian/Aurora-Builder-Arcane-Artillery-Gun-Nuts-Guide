        <description>
            <p>As part of the action used to cast this spell, you must make a ranged attack with a firearm against one creature within the spell's range, otherwise the spell fails. On a hit, the target suffers the attack's normal effects, and blood-red lightning leaps from the target to a different creature of your choice that you can see within 5 feet of it. The second creature takes lightning damage equal to your spellcasting ability modifier.</p>
            <p class="indent">This spell's damage increases when you reach higher levels. At 5th level, the ammunition deals an extra 1d8 lightning damage to the target, and the lightning damage to the second creature increases to 1d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier. Both damage rolls increase by 1d8 at 11th level and 17th level.</p>

            <p>You play or sing a quick little ditty for you or a single ally you can see within range. This spell appears as but a song unless a creature makes a Wisdom(Perception) check to recognize otherwise, the DC of which is determined by your spell save DC. You invigorate your ally and give them the ability to use one the following benefits for 1 minute. Once an ability is used, this spell's effects end.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The creature's movement speed is doubled for one movement action</li>

            <p class="indent">Alternatively, you can use this cantrip to roll the required Saving Throw for your ally to escape a spell's effect, treating it as a Charisma saving throw, instead of using the required attribute dictated by the spell.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can only affect up to three creatures with this spell. If you cast it a fourth time, the spell ends for the first creature it was cast on if the creature has not yet used one of its benefits.</p>

            <p>A glowing bead of ice forms from your finger and shoots out to a point within range, where it remains and grows colder for the duration. When the spell ends, either because your concentration is broken or because you decide to end it on your turn, the bead breaks apart and lets out an ice storm that flash freezes anything near it and spreads around corners. Each creature within a 20 foot radius sphere centered on the point must succeed a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes cold damage equal to the accumulated damage and is paralyzed for a number of rounds equal to the accumulated number on a failed save. If a creature succeeds the save, it takes half the damage and is not paralyzed. A creature can remake the Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its subsequent turns in order to end the paralysis.</p>
            <p class="indent">This spell's base damage is 8d6 and it's base paralysis time is 1 round. If at the end of your turn the bead has not yet detonated, the damage increases by 1d6 and the paralysis increases by 1 round.</p>
            <p class="indent">If the glowing bead is touched before the interval has expired, the creature touching it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the spell ends immediately, causing the bead to explode in a freezing storm of ice. On a successful save, the creature can throw the bead up to 40 feet. When it strikes a creature or a solid object, the spell ends, and the bead explodes. The cold freezes objects in the area and puts out nonmagical flames.</p>

After two rounds, the beam turns the surface within it into cracked and jagged glass, destroying plants and objects that aren't being worn or carried. This turns the area into difficult terrain that is extraordinarily painful to cross. Any creature that moves more than half its speed on this terrain takes 2d10 piercing damage. Structures hit by this beam take double the damage from this spell.</p>
            <p class="indent">You must use your action to maintain the beam. As long as you maintain the beam, your movement speed is 0, and you have disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws. You can use your bonus action to move the beam up to 20 feet in any direction you wish.</p>
